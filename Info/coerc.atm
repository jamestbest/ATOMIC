entry func main(): i4 {
    a: i4= 1;
    b: chr= 2;

    c := a + b; ¬ b should coerce; WHY? because v
    ¬*
        first check if either are valid in the type matrix
         i.e. that at least one is in the right spot

        then choose the larger of the two types
         e.g. i4 is 4 bytes vs chr's 1 byte
         so the target output is i4, left side needs no coercion

        can chr be an i4; can a CHAR be an INTEGER
